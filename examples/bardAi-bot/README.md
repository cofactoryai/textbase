 <br />

## Installation

Make sure you have `python version >=3.9.0`, it's always good to follow the [docs](https://docs.textbase.ai/) üëàüèª
### 1. Follow the installation steps in the [documentation of the textbase framework](https://docs.textbase.ai/get-started/installation)üëàüèª

### 2. After following the steps in the documentation and making sure that you are in the activated `virtualenv`, execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the activated virtual env to install Bard dependency.
### 3. Then [run server](https://docs.textbase.ai/get-started/test-locally#if-you-have-cloned-the-repo) with this command and Give the `main.py` presenet in `examples/bardAi` while running the project.

### 4. If you are using the `textbase-bot` repo for the front end make sure to replace the API URL as mentioned in the `textbase-bot` repository.

## Usage
---
Make sure you have Bard AI opened in the browser
### 1. BardAi doesn't provide API key publically i need to fetch it from developer tools of the cookie section of the browser.
### 9. There is __Secure-1PSID under Bard cookies. need to delete cookies and relogin if the backend is giving errors just like we are having.


Refer to this [video link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZDqygsWxe2S_aA60u1ZrxIZhL09uGKjx/view?usp=sharing) for more ideas from configuring the API key to deploying the bot to textbase website I have recorded them all.


There are known corrections and future modifications to this project feel free to contribute if you want to.
- [X] Native integration of other models (BardAi)
- [ ] Need to display the responses as Google Brad displays with images and links on images as well.

## Demo
---
I'm sure this will not work because the API key must have expired when you are watching this repo but here is a link.

### Note
---
I know that this api key regenerating is a tedioud task but what should we do? we can't control how third party works! Here is a hope https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/AI-ML/Google-Bard-API/m-p/538517.
