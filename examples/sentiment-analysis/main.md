# Sentiment Analysis and Dynamic Input Enhancement

## Description

This pull request represents a significant advancement for the textbase open-source project, as it introduces essential enhancements that improve the capabilities and user experience of the main.py chatbots. Specifically, sentiment analysis functionality has been integrated, allowing chatbots to discern the emotional tone of user inputs. Additionally, a dynamic input variable has been introduced, enabling users to customize the chatbot's behavior based on specific contexts, effectively transforming the chatbot into a highly adaptable product.

## Problem

The absence of sentiment analysis functionality within the textbase project had been limiting the effectiveness of chatbot interactions. Without the ability to gauge the emotional content of user inputs, the chatbots were unable to tailor their responses appropriately, leading to suboptimal and sometimes inappropriate replies, particularly for neutral or negative inputs.

## Features Added

### Sentiment Analysis

VADER sentiment analysis model integration has been seamlessly incorporated into the project. This enhancement empowers the chatbots to accurately classify user inputs into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories. This means that the chatbots can now respond in a more contextually relevant and emotionally intelligent manner.

### Dynamic Input Variable

To increase flexibility and utility, a dynamic input variable has been introduced. Users can now specify an input variable, such as "legal advisor," which instructs the chatbot to adopt a persona or context-specific behavior. This innovative feature enables the chatbots to transcend their original templated structure, making them versatile tools adaptable to a multitude of domains.

## Impact

The significance of these enhancements cannot be overstated. With the inclusion of sentiment analysis, the chatbots' responses are elevated to a higher level of sophistication, as they now comprehend and consider the emotional nuances of user inputs. Furthermore, the dynamic input variable feature provides users with the means to fashion chatbots that align precisely with their intended purposes, effectively broadening the appeal of textbase to diverse user groups, developers, and industries.

This pull request not only addresses the prior limitation of lacking sentiment analysis but also introduces an innovation that augments the project's utility and user experience. These changes propel textbase toward becoming an all-encompassing, user-centric tool for crafting interactive and emotionally attuned chatbot applications.
