## Scope
Integrating NewsAPI to fetch Real-time, Financial, and latest data using Semantic search with SentenceTransformers


This pull request is made to make the bot more user-friendly. Now, this bot can provide answers dealing with real-time data, 
financial data and latest news after 2019, which an openAI bot cannot answer. This bot handles the limitations of the Generic OpenAI bot

Strategy Used:

1. I integrated a 3rd party NewsAPI to extract the latest up-to-date news in the form json strings
2. After extracting all the news articles, I used semantic search with sentenceTransformers, with which we can semantically search
for the most similar or relevant document to the user's query. 
3. Then I ranked the top kth relevant documents based on cosine similarity scores
4. The user will be able to view the document Titles and URLs whenever he asks for real-time or financial or latest news that an OpenAI
cannot answer

Libraries Installed
1. Installed SentenceTransformers library for semantic search 
2. Integrated NewsAPI with a unique API key that one can freely obtain after logging onto the NewsAPI website
