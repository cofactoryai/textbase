# TextBase

## What is textbase?
:sparkles: Textbase is a framework for building chatbots using NLP and ML. :sparkles:

Since it is just Python you can use whatever models, libraries, vector databases and APIs you want!

Coming soon:
- [x] [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/textbase-client/)
- [x] Easy web deployment via [textbase-client deploy](../docs/deployment/deploy-from-cli.md)
- [ ] SMS integration
- [ ] Native integration of other models (Claude, Llama, ...)
