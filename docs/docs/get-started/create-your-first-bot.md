# Create your first bot

You can make your own model using NLP and ML or you can make use of one of our inbuilt models. To use our inbuilt models, you can import the `models` module.

Currently we support:
- OpenAI
- HuggingFace ([Microsoft/dialoGPT-large](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/DialoGPT-large))
- BotLibre
- Replicate ([a16z-infra/llama-2-13b-chat](https://replicate.com/a16z-infra/llama-2-13b-chat))
