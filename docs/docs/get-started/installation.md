1. Make sure to [upgrade/install](https://www.python.org/downloads/) your `Python` installation to a `version >= 3.9` and add it to your `PATH` while installing.
2. Run `pip install textbase-client`.

For the usage of commands through this library, refer to the [usage](../usage.md) section.

## Local installation of the library

Before getting started with the instructions for installing the library locally, make sure that you have done this prerequisite steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repo
3. Open the repo in your VS Code
4. Install the VS Code extension for Python if not already done.

### Guide for Windows

1. Make sure to [upgrade/install](https://www.python.org/downloads/) your `Python` installation to a `version >= 3.9` and add it to your `PATH` while installing.
2. Now, you need to [install](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) `Poetry`, which is a python dependency manager which makes your life easier. To do so, you can just run
    ```bash
    pip install poetry
    ```
3. Use the keyboard combo <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> and search for `Terminal: Select Default Profile` and select `Command Prompt`.
4. You can open the VS Code terminal using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>\`</kbd> and then run the command below in the VSCode terminal inside the folder where you have cloned textbase repo. This makes sure that Poetry makes a virtual environment inside your current directory. This command does not give you any output.
    ```bash
    poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
    ```
5. `poetry shell`
6. Use the keyboard combo <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> and select `Python: Select Interpreter` (you can type this option in if it's not visible) and make sure after running this you have selected the Poetry interpreter.

### Guide for Ubuntu (â‰¤19.04)

1. Follow this [guide](https://gist.github.com/basaks/652eea861a143a9b3d11805c96273488) to install `Python version 3.9`.
2. Install pip using
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python-pip
    ```
3. Install poetry using
    ```bash
    pip install poetry
    ```
4. Add it to your path using
    ```bash
    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
    ```
5. You can open the VS Code terminal using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>\`</kbd> (Mac: <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>\`</kbd>) and then run the command: `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true` in the VS Code terminal inside the folder where you have cloned textbase repo so that Poetry makes a `.venv` folder inside your current project directory. This command does not give you any output.
6. Running the commands below will make a new virtual Python environment inside the current directory and then you can select the default python interpreter to be the one in the `.venv` folder.
    ```bash
    cd textbase
    poetry shell
    ```
7. In order to select the default python interpreter in VS Code, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (Mac: <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) and select `Python: Select Interpreter` (you can type this option in if it's not visible) and make sure after running this you have selected the Poetry interpreter.
