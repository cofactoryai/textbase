# Open AI bot

This bot makes an API call to OpenAI and processes the user input. It uses GPT-3.5 Turbo.

```py
from textbase import bot, Message
from textbase.models import OpenAI
from typing import List

# Load your OpenAI API key
OpenAI.api_key = ""

# Prompt for GPT-3.5 Turbo
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are chatting with an AI. There are no specific prefixes for responses, so you can ask or talk about anything you like.
The AI will respond in a natural, conversational manner. Feel free to start the conversation with any question or topic, and let's have a
pleasant chat!
"""
