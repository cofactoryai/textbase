# Textbase

✨ Textbase is a framework for building chatbots using NLP and ML. ✨

Just implement the `on_message` function in `main.py` and Textbase will take care of the rest :)

Since it is just Python you can use whatever models, libraries, vector databases and APIs you want.

_Coming soon:_

- [ ] PyPI package
- [ ] SMS integration
- [ ] Easy web deployment via `textbase deploy`
- [ ] Native integration of other models (Claude, Llama, ...)

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (you might have to [install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) first).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cofactoryai/textbase
cd textbase
poetry install
```

## Start development server

> If you're using the default template, **remember to set the OpenAI API key** in `main.py` or create a `.env` file in root directory

Set the following line to your `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

Run the following command to start dev server:

```bash
poetry run python textbase/textbase_cli.py test main.py
```

Now go to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and start chatting with your bot! The bot will automatically reload when you change the code.

_Simpler version using PyPI package and CLI coming soon!_
